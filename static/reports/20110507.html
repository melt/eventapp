Also the user should be asked if he/she wishes to Skype with ambassador before the event (if possible) "Spend a small amount of time Skyping each guest before a Sandbox event. Understand current challenges and projects of each guest and how it may overlap with other guests. From this you can design effective seating plans."

The form should also start with a "Is this still you"? section where user can update Company/Affiliation and other relevant fields.

I currently live is an important field.

If NO then mail should optionally ask why the person does not wish to attend for reference.</span></td><td class="ta_item"><span>Apr 29, 12:56</span></td><td class="ta_item"><span>Open</span></td><td class="ta_item"><span><!--4 -->Low</span></td><td class="ta_item"><span>View</span></td><td class="ta_item"><span>Per Jonsson</span></td><td class="ta_item last"><span>Apr 29, 13:25</span></td></tr><tr class="ta_bordered"><td class="ta_item"><span><strong class="icon_title">Task</strong></span></td><td class="ta_item"><span>#26</span></td><td class="ta_item darkness"><span>Pre-invite email to other ambassadors</span><span class="gray_pv_desc">Ambassador should be able to send a pre-invite mail to other ambassadors looking for cool friends to invite
