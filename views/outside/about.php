<h2>What is Sandbox?</h2>
<p>
    Sandbox started in 2008 and is now the foremost global community of extraordinary young achievers below 30. 
    We identify exceptional people worldwide that already have an impressive impact at a very young age, no matter in what field or industry. 
</p>

<p>
    The growing community counts 550 young leaders in 45 different countries. We organize regular events in more than 18 cities in the US, in Europe and in Asia. 
    We have a full time team based in four locations, working day and night to create value for the community.
